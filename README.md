# Autonomous-Object-Training-and-Detection-System-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This repository is a part of my Master thesis in Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. 

The thesis aims to demonstrate the solution to the problem known as "Catastrophic Forgetting" when training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The solution to the problem is called "Incremental Learning". 

In this repository, I selected one well-known technique, "Learning-without-Forgetting" to demonstrate incremental learning with custom dataset.

The diagram below shows how does it works
